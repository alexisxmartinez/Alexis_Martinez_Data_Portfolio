# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! Here you can find examples of my data science and analytics projects that showcase my skills and experience in the field. 

## Project Examples

1. Customer Segmentation: Using transactional data from a UK-based online retailer, I segmented customers to better understand their behavior and preferences.

2. Sentiment Analysis: I performed sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to gain insights into public opinion about products, services, and brands.

3. Fraud Detection: Using a credit card fraud detection dataset, I built machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.

4. Predictive Maintenance: I used sensor data from an industrial machine to predict equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

5. Image Classification: I trained deep learning models to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset, with applications in object recognition and face detection.

Each project demonstrates my ability to perform exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation, and visualization to provide meaningful insights and solve real-world problems. 

Feel free to explore each project to learn more about my work. Thank you for visiting!
